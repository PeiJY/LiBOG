# LiBOG


Official implementation of our paper **"LiBOG: Lifelong Learning for Black-Box Optimizer Generation"**, which is accepted at *IJCAI* 2025. In this work, we tackle the problem of **lifelong learning from a sequence of BBO problem distributions to generate high-performance BBO optimizer** using a novel **LiBOG**, which achieves **good forward transferring, mild catastrophic forgetting and stable learning**.
